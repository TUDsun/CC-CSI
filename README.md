# CC-CSI

Cross-correlated Contrast Source Inversion 
==========================================

CC-CSI is a MATLAB-based package of the `cross-correlated contrast source inversion` algorithm. This package inverts the Fresnel data with multiple frequency components. In addition, it also contains the MR-CSI (multiplicative-regularized CSI) and CSI algorithms. Comparison over can be easily made to verify the advantage of the introduction of the so-called `cross-correlated error`.
