# CC-CSI

Cross-Correlated Contrast Source Inversion 
------------------------------------------

CC-CSI is a MATLAB-based package of the *cross-correlated contrast source inversion* algorithm. This package inverts the Fresnel data with multiple frequency components. In addition, it also contains the implementation of MR-CSI (multiplicative-regularized CSI) and CSI algorithms. Comparison can be easily made to verify the advantage of introducing the so-called *cross-correlated error term*.
